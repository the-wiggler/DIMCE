IMCF - Integral Monte Carlo Fortran
* Uses parallel processes to estimate the integral of a function over a given range

IMCP - Integral Monte Carlo Python
* Uses Cupy, a library adaptation of NumPy, to run python code on a GPU to estimate the integral of a funcion over a given range.

Functions as a simple research project on how changing different parameters in a monte carlo software will affect things such as calculation time, accuracy, etc
